# Learning Functional Programming in Scala

I created this project to have a place to write implementations (with unit tests) for all the exercises in the Manning Functional Programming in Scala book (<https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala>).

To use this project, do the following:

1. Set up _$ANT\_HOME_, _$JAVA\_HOME_, and _$SCALA\_HOME_ envrionment variables.
1. Add _$ANT\_HOME/bin_ to the path.
1. Clone project.
1. Run _ant test_ to run all the unit tests in the project.

Source code is in _./src_. Unit tests are in _./test/unit_. Packages represent chapters in the book.

A special thanks to [@anicolaspp](https://twitter.com/anicolaspp) for the encouragement to get started with learning FP in Scala. Many came before him extolling the virtues of this new paradigm, but he was the one that put the book in my hand and told me to learn. And so I am learning. Thank you.

I encourage you to follow [@anicolaspp](https://twitter.com/anicolaspp) on Twitter and check out his articles on Scala (and all things programming) at <https://medium.com/@anicolaspp>.
